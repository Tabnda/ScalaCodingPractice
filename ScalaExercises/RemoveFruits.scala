package ScalaExercises

object RemoveFruits extends App{
  /**
  Assume a shopping basket with the following items: "Milk", "Cheese", "Donuts", "Apples", "Bananas".
  Represent the above items into an appropriate data structure,
  and thereafter define and use a value function that will remove all fruit items from the shopping basket.
  In other words, the shopping basket should only contain items "Milk", "Cheese" and "Donuts".
  Note also that the resulting output should be represented as an XML element format as shown below.
  Output:
  <items values= "Milk|Cheese|Donuts"></items>
  **/
  //val ShoppingBasket = Set("Milk","Cheese","Donuts","Apples","Bananas")
  //val filterFruitItemsF = (string) => Boolean = (s) => s == "Apples" || s == "Bananas" // Anonymous Functions
  //val BasketWithoutFruits = ShoppingBasket.filterNot(filterFruitItemsF)
  //println(BasketWithoutFruits.mkString("<items values= \"", "|", "\"></items>"))
